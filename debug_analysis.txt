    // We assume the environment is set up similar to the app, or we might need service account
    // But in this environment, we might rely on the existing config or mock it?
    // Actually, running a standalone script accessing Firestore locally requires credentials.
    // The previous scripts worked because they probably used mocked data or the user has creds?
    // Wait, the user has `src/lib/firebase.ts` which uses `firebase-admin`.
    // Let's try to grab the credential from env vars if available.
    // Or we can try to import the app's db module?
    // Importing app modules in a standalone script with 'ts-node' can be tricky due to aliases (@/...).
    
    // Simplest way: Just inspect the JSON file again. If trips.json says it has hotels, and deploy script uploads trips.json...
    // verify deploy script uploads JSON.
    // deploy_gcp.sh: 
    // # Sync Data Files (trips.json, cityImages.json)
    // gcloud storage cp src/data/*.json gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/data/
    
    // Wait! The deploy script uploads JSON to the BUCKET, not Firestore.
    // The APP reads from Firestore.
    // DOES THE APP SYNC FROM BUCKET TO FIRESTORE?
    // I don't recall seeing a sync mechanism on startup in `page.tsx`.
    // The app reads from Firestore.
    // When was Firestore populated?
    // Maybe checking `src/data/trips.json` is misleading if Firestore wasn't updated from it recently.
    
    // I need to check if there is a sync script.
    // `scripts/backfill_coordinates.ts` was run.
    
    // Checking if `trips.json` matches Firestore is crucial.
    // I can't easily run a script to connect to PROD Firestore without the key file.
    // The key is in `.env.local` or environment.
    // But `src/lib/firebase.ts` uses `getApps()`.
